# School Database
### A backend system for tests, teachers, and students
Language: *C#*<br />
Framework: *ASP.net*<br />
Database: *SQLite*<br />

## Purpose of the Project
Orginally it was for a school project, but I am hoping to eventually use it to make an actual backend system for something like the Student Portal for Maricopa Community Colleges (since that site is terrible)
